                <p>101 Amazing Cat Facts: Fun Trivia About Your Feline Friend
                    These fun facts about cats will make you feel all fuzzy inside.


                    You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware of just how cool your she — and her overall
                    species — really is. For example, did you know that cats have an extra organ that allows them to
                    taste scents? Or that they developed meowing as a way to communicate exclusively with humans?

                <h2>Dogs</h2>
                <p>The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris)[4] is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized
                    by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf
                    is the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by
                    hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the development of agriculture.[</p>

                <h2>Snakes</h2>
                <p>There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they’re found everywhere except in
                    Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. About 600 species are venomous, and only
                    about 200—seven percent—are able to kill or significantly wound a human.</p>

        <h1>About Pets</h1>
        <img src="images/dog2.jpg" alt="" height="200px">
        <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than
            as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive
            appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis
            (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
